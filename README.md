# Magnetic Field Simulation and Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating and analyzing the magnetic field generated by a rotating and translating actuator magnet. The code calculates the magnetic field components, magnetic field gradient, and forces or torques generated by the interaction between the actuator and robot magnets.

## Overview

- **Magnetic Field Calculation**: Computes the magnetic field generated by an actuator magnet and its interaction with a robot magnet.
- **Field Analysis**: Analyzes the rotating and translating components of the magnetic field over time.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Calculates the gradient of the magnetic field along a specified distance.
- **Force and Torque Calculation**: Calculates the force and torque generated by the magnetic field interaction.

## Features

- Simulation of magnetic field along a specified distance.
- Visualization of magnetic field components over time.
- Calculation of magnetic field gradient.
- Calculation of forces and torques based on the magnetic field interaction.

## Code Details

### Initialization

- `mu0`: Permeability of free space.
- `f`: Frequency of rotation.
- `M0`: Volume magnetization of the actuator magnet.
- `a`, `l`: Dimensions of the actuator magnet (cylinder).
- `Vy`: Translational speed along the y-axis.

### Magnetic Field Calculation

- Computes the magnetic field along the z-axis using actuator magnet properties.
- Defines rotating magnetic field components in the x and z directions.

### Plotting

- **Magnetic Field Plot**: Shows the magnetic field (Tesla) along the distance `z`.
- **Rotating Magnetic Field Plot**: Displays the rotation of magnetic field components over time.
- **3D Rotating Magnetic Field Plot**: Shows the rotating magnetic field components in 3D.
- **Gradient Plot**: Displays the gradient of the magnetic field along the distance `z`.
- **Force and Torque Plots**: Shows the force and torque calculated based on the magnetic field interaction.

### Calculation
